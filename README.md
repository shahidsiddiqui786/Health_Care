## Inspiration 🌱
When was the last time you went for a medical diagnosis to a professional doctor? Well, we all seek professional advice when we have a serious discomfort. But sometimes we just ignore the symptoms for reasons like: 
- Discomfort feels temporary (after all frequent professional visits will **cost** you a lot).
- Unavailability of time due to piles of work to be done.
- Unavailablity of professionals in the times of emergency.

With the advancements in modern day medical science, we have been able to provide solutions to a lot of health problems that were impossible around 50 years ago.  The inspiration for this web app was to provide people with a handy app that can give them a clinical solution based on first impression symptoms, thus making health care convenient, accessible and available to all.

## What it does 👀
Our team wanted to build a product that can help users get a rough idea of the possible health problems that they might be facing based on the symptoms provided by them. The application asks for generic data and the main symptoms that the user is feeling, then uses Natural Language Processing in the form of API to predict possibilities. Prompts are provided to the user in order to understand the condition in a better way, and final predictions indicate the highly likely disease/illness that the user might have. Thus, user only needs to have a internet connection in order to have a free-of-cost medical check up at the ease of a phone screen.

## How we built it ⚒️
We have used Javascript as our primary development language. Libraries such as Vanilla, jQuery, Lodash, Popper have been used for various functionalities of the app. Responsive styles have been obtained by using Bootstrap.

## Challenges 🌪
The app kept breaking after adding different views for each time the prediction was made. It took a lot of time for us to configure the API responses and have a seamless connection between the Front-end components and views.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 🌟
We were able to create a live working demo with correct predictions based on the input symptoms.

## What we learned ✍🏻
*This is the first time we’ve participated in a 24-hour hackathon*. Working in a time constraint while enjoying it at the same time is such an underrated skill. 

## What's next for HealthCare App 💙
We plan on adding new functionalities such as:
1. Adding a chatbot for a more personalized way to interact.
2. Providing instant diagnosis suggestions based on what the user confirms as illness.
3. Recommending specialists based on illness type.
4. Generation of final resultes as a PDF format report.

**Please note that the project is submitted for the 18+ division** ⚠️

Let's work towards making HealthCare for everyone! 🕊
